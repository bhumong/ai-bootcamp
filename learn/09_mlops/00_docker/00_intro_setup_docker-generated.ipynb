This way we can then use the terminal to input other commands, such as docker ps to check the running containers. Without the -d flag, the terminal will appear to “hang up” because it’s being used by the Docker container. - -p flag = port mapping. This flag is used commonly like this: -p 8888:8888 which means we want to map the host port of 8888 at the front with the container port of 8888 at the back. This allows for some customization. Let’s say for example, the host port of 8888 is taken, we can then map the host port to another empty port, such as 8889. Thus the flag becomes -p 8889:8888. - --name flag = naming the container.
