In this scenario, the salary distribution exhibits positive skewness, because the CEO’s high salary pulls the average up, making the median (middle salary) a better representative of the typical salary within the company.If we were to consider a situation where most employees earn high salaries, but a few earn significantly less (negative skewness), the median salary would still provide a more accurate representation as it would be higher than the average, which is pulled down by the few low salaries.Thus, in skewed salary data, the median is a more reliable and representative measure of central tendency."
