    "Imagine that we already know that there are 50% librarian that are shy, while there is only 14% farmer that are shy. If we pick random person from the population that is considered shy, what is the probability that the person is a librarian? The heart of bayesian theorem is that when we’re considering our bias that it’s a lot more likely a librarian is shy than a farmer, when we want to say that “Then there should be a lot more shy librarian than shy farmer”, we need to consider that maybe there are a lot more farmer than librarian in the population."
