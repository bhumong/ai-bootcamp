You may also have knowledge of front-end frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap or React, which can help streamline the development process and provide pre-built components.\\n\\nOther skills you may have acquired include knowledge of web accessibility standards, understanding of browser compatibility issues, and familiarity with version control systems like Git. Overall, studying front-end engineering equips you with the skills needed to create visually appealing and interactive websites or applications.'"
