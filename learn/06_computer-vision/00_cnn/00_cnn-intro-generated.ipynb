    "Computers are very good at being consistent and processing numbers. But they’re blind, sure they can show images for us in our monitor, but it cannot directly interact with us like human-to-human interaction. Like giving us feedback or help us monitor our CCTV feed and let us know if something is suspicious. That’s because until the recent age of AI, computers are blind. There are attempts to emulate vision, which is what the field Computer Vision is. Let’s start with how we see the world."

    "From the picture above, the input image goes through the convolution process in the convolution layer and the output is a feature map. The feature map then went through subsampling in the Pooling layer (subsampling layer) which effectively reduces the size by half, and so on, until it reaches the final layer which is a fully connected layer where the input is processed to return a probability between 0 and 1. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object."
