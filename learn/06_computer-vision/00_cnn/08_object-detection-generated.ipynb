It excels at swiftly detecting and localizing objects within images or video frames, making it valuable for various applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and computer vision tasks. YOLO’s fame stems from its unique approach of dividing images into grids and simultaneously predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities within each grid cell. This one-pass design makes it exceptionally fast and suitable for real-time tasks. While YOLO is versatile and widely used, it may not be ideal for scenarios involving small objects, extreme size variations, or very high localization precision requirements, and it typically demands substantial training data for optimal performance."
