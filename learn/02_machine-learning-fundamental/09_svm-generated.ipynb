Because \\(\\alpha_i\\) and \\(C\\) are data that is part of the model output after training, but \\(K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)\\) is the kernel function that we are interested because this value is derived from the input data, and as you can see, the kernel function is outputting the dot product between two vectors in a higher dimension."
