It’s kind of like a student learning under the guidance of a teacher. The ‘teacher’, in this case, is the label that tells the model about the data so it can learn from it. Once the model is trained with this labelled data, it can start to make predictions or decisions when new, unlabeled data is fed to it. A common example of supervised learning is classifying emails into “spam” or “not spam”."

Good features capture important aspects of the data and provide information that helps the model make correct predictions."
